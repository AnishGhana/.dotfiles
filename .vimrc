Anish Ghana

Summary of process: First I opened the terminal, then I used the "pwd" command to show the global path in the file system. I then used the ls -a commandto see more files. I then used vim .vimrc to create a VIM configuration file. I inserted some configurations. I saved and quitted then went back in to see my changes. I force quitted and renamed it to a text file. I then wrote this summary. I faced no significant hurdles here.
